                        <p><strong>We believe in the Holy Scripture:</strong>Accepting fully the writings of the Old and
                            New Testaments as
                            the inerrant Word of God, verbally inspired in all parts and therefore altogether sufficient
                            as our only infallible
                            and authoritative rule of faith and practice. We use the King James Version for our
                            preaching and teaching in the English Language. In Swahili, we use the Union Version, and we
                            will diligently seek the best
                            translation in all the other languages. Psalm 119:160; Proverbs 30:5a; II Timothy 3:16, 17;
                            II Peter 1:19-21.</p>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the one true God :</strong> Who is an intelligent, sovereign, spiritual
                            and personal Being; perfect, infinite, and eternal in His being, holiness and love, wisdom
                            and power; absolutely separate from and above the world as its Creator, yet everywhere
                            present in the world as the Upholder of all things.
                            He is revealed to us as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three distinct persons, but without
                            division of nature, essence or being, and each having a distinct ministry in God’s relation
                            to His creation and people. Genesis 1:1; Exodus 15:11; Psalm 83:18; 139:7-9; Matthew 28:19;
                            John 10:30; 15:26.</p>

                        <p><strong>We believe in the Lord Jesus Christ :</strong>Who is the second Person of the Triune
                            God, the eternal Word and Only Begotten Son; that without any change in His divine Person,
                            He became man by miracle of the virgin birth, thus to continue forever as both true God and
                            true Man, one Person with two natures; that as Man He was tempted in all points as we are,
                            yet without sin; that as the perfect Lamb of God He gave Himself in death by the shedding of
                            His blood upon the cross, bearing there the sin of the world, and suffering its full penalty
                            of divine wrath in our stead; that He arose from the grave in a glorified body; that as our
                            great High
                            Priest He ascended into Heaven, there to appear before the face of God as our Advocate and
                            Intercessor. John 1:1, 14; 3:16; Matthew 1:18-25; Galatians 4:4, 5; Philippians 2:6-10; I
                            Corinthians 15:3-7; Hebrews 4:14-16; I John 2:1, 2.</p>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the Holy Spirit:</strong>Who is the Third Person of the Trinity, and
                            the divine Agent in nature, revelation and redemption; that He convicts the world concerning
                            sin, righteousness, and judgment; that He regenerates, indwells, baptizes, seals and anoints
                            all who become children of God through Christ; that He further empowers, guides, teaches,
                            sanctifies and fills believers who daily surrender to Him.

                            direct creation of God, made in His image and likeness; that by personal disobedience to the
                            revealed will of God, man became a sinful creature, the father of a fallen race which is
                            universally sinful in both nature and practice, thus alienated from the life and family of
                            God, under the righteous judgment and wrath of God, and has within
                            himself no possible means of salvation. Genesis 1:27; 3:6; Psalm 51:5; Romans 3:23; 5:12,19;
                            Galatians 3:11.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in salvation by grace through faith :</strong>That salvation is the free
                            gift of God, neither merited nor secured in part or in whole by any virtue or work of man,
                            but received only by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom all true believers
                            have as a present possession the gift of eternal life, a perfect righteousness, sonship in
                            the family of God, deliverance and security from all condemnation, every spiritual resource
                            needed for life and godliness, and the divine guarantee that they shall never perish; that
                            this salvation affects the whole man; that apart from Christ there
                            is no possible salvation. Ephesians 2:8, 9; Titus 3:5; John 1:12; 3:14; 10:28, 29; Romans
                            8:1; Philippians 1:6.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in righteous living and godly works:</strong>Not as a means of salvation
                            in any sense, but as its proper evidence and fruit; and therefore as Christians we should
                            obey the Word of our Lord, seek the things which are above, walk as He walked, accept as our
                            solemn responsibility the duty and privileges of bearing the gospel to a lost world;
                            remembering that a victorious and fruitful Christian life is possible only for those who in
                            gratitude for the infinite and undeserved mercies of God have presented themselves wholly to
                            Christ. Ephesians 2:10; Romans 12:1, 2; Philippians 2:16.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the existence of satan :</strong>Who originally was created a holy and
                            perfect being, but through pride and wicked ambition rebelled against God, thus becoming
                            utterly depraved in character, the great adversary of God and His people, the leader of all
                            other evil angels and wicked spirits, the deceiver and god of this present world: that his
                            powers are vast, but strictly limited by the permissive will of God who overrules all his
                            wicked devices for good; that he was defeated and judged at the cross, and therefore his
                            final doom is certain; that we are able to resist and overcome him only in the armor of God,
                            by the blood of the Lamb and through the power of the Holy Spirit. Isaiah 14:12-15;
                            Ephesians 6:12; I Peter 5:8; I John 3:8; Revelation 12:9-11; 20:10.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the second coming of Christ :</strong> That His coming in the air to
                            rapture His Church, which is our blessed Hope, is always imminent; that when He has first by
                            resurrection of the dead and translation of the living removed from the earth His waiting
                            Church, He will then pour out the righteous judgments of God upon the unbelieving world and
                            afterwards descend with His Church and establish His glorious and literal kingdom over all
                            the nations for a thousand years. I Thessalonians 4:13-18; James 5:8; Hebrews 10:37; Jude
                            14, 15; Revelation 19:11-16; 20:4-7.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in future life, bodily resurrection and eternal judgment :</strong>That
                            the spirits of the saved at death go immediately to be with Christ in Heaven, that their
                            works shall be brought before the Judgment Seat of Christ for the determination of rewards
                            which will take place at the time when Christ comes for His own; that the spirits of the
                            unsaved at death descend immediately into Hades where they are kept under punishment until
                            the final day of judgment, at which time their bodies shall be raised from the grave, that
                            they shall be judged and cast into Hell, the place of final and everlasting
                            punishment. I Corinthians 15; II Corinthians 5:8-10; Luke 16:19-23; Revelation 20:11-15.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the separation of church and state :</strong>With each having definite
                            and distinct spheres of responsibility. Matthew 22:21; Romans 13:1-7.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the priesthood of all believers :</strong>That Christ is our Great High
                            Priest and through Him every born again person has direct access into God’s presence without
                            the need of a human priest; that the believer has the right and responsibility to personally
                            study and interpret the Scriptures guided
                            by the Holy Spirit. John 14:6; Hebrews 4:16; II Timothy 2:15; I Peter 2:1, 5, 9.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the institution of the home as defined by Scripture :</strong>That it
                            was divinely established in the beginning as the union by marriage of a male and female and
                            is the basic unit of society; that each family member, husband, wife, or child, has distinct
                            duties and responsibilities; that it is the responsibility of parents to train up children
                            in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and to provide them godly instruction through
                            Christian example and formal education. Genesis 2:18-25; 3:16; 18:19; Deuteronomy 6:4-9;
                            32:46; Psalm 78:5, 6; 127:1-5; Proverbs 3:12; 13:24; 22:6; Isaiah 28:9,10; Matthew 19:3-9;
                            Ephesians 5:21-33; 6:1-4; Colossians 3:18-21.</p>
                    </li>



                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the importance of the local church :</strong>That all believers should
                            assemble and identify themselves in local churches; that a New Testament church is a local
                            assembly of born again baptized believers united in organization to practice New Testament
                            ordinances, to meet together for worship, prayer, fellowship, teaching and a united
                            testimony, and to actively engage in carrying out the Great Commission. Acts 2:41, 42; I
                            Corinthians 11:2; Matthew 28:19, 20.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe in the independence and autonomy of the local church :</strong>That each
                            New Testament church is free to govern itself without ecclesiastical interference, and
                            should cooperate with other New Testament churches as the Holy Spirit leads; that it is
                            responsible to follow the pattern of the New Testament church and is directly accountable
                            to God. Matthew 18:17; Acts 6:1-5; 13:1-3; 15:22, 23.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: initial;">
                        <p><strong>We believe the ordinances given to the local church are two, baptism and the Lord’s
                                supper :</strong>That baptism is by immersion of believers, thus portraying the death,
                            burial, and the resurrection of Jesus Christ; that the Lord’s Supper is the partaking of the
                            bread and cup by the believer as a continuing memorial of the broken body and shed blood of
                            Christ. Matthew 28:19, 20; Acts 2:41; 8:38, 39; Matthew 26:26-30; I Corinthians 11:23-34.
