                <p style="font-size:16px;">Think carefully on this soul-searching question: </p> <br>
                <h4>"IF YOU SHOULD DIE RIGHT NOW, DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN?"</h4>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size:16px;">If your answer is anything other than, "Yes, I am absolutely certain that my
                    sins are forgiven and that Heaven will be my home," then here is an important message just for you.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:16px;">The Bible teaches that you need to know and believe four things to settle
                    your eternity:</p>
                <p style="font-size:16px;">First, you have sinned against God -- "For all have sinned, and come short of
                    the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) Next, you must know where sin leads -- "For the wages of sin is
                    death..." (Romans 6:23a)</p>
                <p style="font-size:16px;">The wonderful news of the Bible is that Jesus died in your place to pay your
                    sin penalty -- "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ
                    died for us." (Romans 5:8) GOD WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE HIS WORD AND ACCEPT HIS SON, JESUS, AS YOUR
                    PERSONAL SAVIOR.</p>

                <p>Friend, if you have believed The Gospel and thus trusted in Jesus’ shed Blood alone for your sins,
                    you have according to the Word of God been born into God’s family! Welcome! We love you and are so

                    exactly you are to start living out your new Christian life in a practical day-to-day way. Well
                    fellow believer, one the most crucial things for you to do now is to start growing in your faith and
                    become grounded and steadfast in your understanding of the Bible and it’s foundational doctrines.
                    The reason this is important to do friend is so you can learn to live in a way that pleases your
                    Heavenly Father the most, as well as such will allow you to also equip yourself effectively so that
                    you can start leading the lost to the Lord Jesus Christ and contending for and defending the faith.

                <h4>
                    The following therefore is a recommended list of ways to start growing as a believer:
                </h4><br>
                <p>
                    (1) Purchase a King James Bible and study it daily.
                    Set aside deliberate time each day for God for both studying and prayer and get to know the One Who
                    sacrificed His Only Begotten Son for you one-on-One. Remember, the Bible represents God’s
                    instruction manual on how we are supposed to live as Christians, and should govern all matters of
                    faith and practice in the life of a believer. Before you begin studying, be sure to go over our page
                    on Basic Rules of Biblical Interpretation so that you can maximize your study time from the very
                    beginning. It is however important to mention too friend that as you begin to study the Bible things
                    may not always make absolute sense the first time, the second time, or even the third time through,
                    but keep studying and asking for God’s
                    guidance through prayer and the Holy Spirit Who lives inside you will lead you into all truth (John
                    16:13).

                    (2) Read the pages offered on this site repeatedly and become very familiar with the clear Bible
                    doctrines declared and defended on them. Also visit the recommended resources available outside of
                    this site for additional learning. Remember though, the Bible is the authority and all others are in
                    subject to it. Not the other way around. Having said that though, the resources offered outside of
                    this site have been very carefully and intensely scrutinized by the group and thus are recommended.  </p>
                   

               
                <p>
                        (3) Join a local church *if there is one* that preaches out of the King James Bible, is 100% CLEAR on the Gospel, as well as the other foundational Bible doctrines found on this site. To be blunt, if the church you are considering is not 100% CLEAR on the Gospel, proper Bible doctrine, or desperately concerned with the eternal salvation of the lost by preaching the CLEAR Gospel to them, then it is not recommended that you join it no matter how appealing the peripheral attractions are (music, dress, building, etc). Remember, salvation is by Grace alone, through faith alone,
                         in Christ crucified alone, and anyone who preaches a false Gospel is under the curse of God (Gal 1:8-9).
                         <br> <br>
                         There is a much repeated falsity circulating Christianity today that states “there is no such thing
                         as a perfect church” or “you just need to chew up the meat and spit out the bones”. Although we
                         certainly acknowledge that there many churches which are comprised of saved individuals who battle
                         with the two natures (Spirit vs. flesh), and so their personalities and character are flawed on
                         different levels in their flesh, there are churches that have perfect doctrine. Friend, this is the
                         type of the church that you should be seeking to join and we believe it is never wise to join a
                         church who’s attitude is “to chew up the meat (accurate doctrine) and spit out the bones (false
                         doctrine)” that is being offered from the pulpit. This type of tolerance can eventually lead to
                         further compromise of a church and a potential sliding into further apostasy and/or heresy.
